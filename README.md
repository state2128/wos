# Zero Aggression Pact (ZAP) Rules

Welcome to the **Zero Aggression Pact (ZAP)**! Below are the guidelines that help maintain a fair and enjoyable experience for everyone in the state:

1. **Freedom of Speech**  
   No restrictions on speech in world or private chats. If you find someone's language offensive, use the blacklist feature to block them.

2. **City Attacks**  
   No attacks on cities unless the player is not part of an alliance.

3. **Scouting**  
   Scouting is permitted at all times.

4. **Alliance Structures**  
   Attacks on Alliance Headquarters or banners are strictly prohibited.

5. **Tile Attacks**  
   Tile attacks are allowed, but only on cities that occupy space or gather in another alliance's territory.

6. **Scheduled Battles**  
   Alliances can schedule battles with each other by mutual agreement. Have some honor, quit attacking when everyone is offline.

7. **Presidency Election**  
   The presidency will be decided by an election where each alliance gets one vote.

8. **Whale Distribution**  
   High-powered players ("whales") should be distributed across the top 10 alliances to ensure power is not concentrated within just a few alliances. This will make facility battles more competitive, fun, and a learning experience for everyone.
