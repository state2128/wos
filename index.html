        <h1>Zero Aggression Pact (ZAP) Rules</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the <strong>Zero Aggression Pact (ZAP)</strong>! Below are the guidelines that help maintain a fair and enjoyable experience for everyone in the state:</p>

        <h2>Rules</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Freedom of Speech:</strong> No restrictions on speech in world or private chats. If you find someone's language offensive, use the blacklist feature to block them.</li>
            <li><strong>Scouting:</strong> Scouting is permitted at all times.</li>
            <li><strong>Alliance Structures:</strong> Attacks on Alliance Headquarters or banners are strictly prohibited.</li>
            <li><strong>Tile Attacks:</strong> Tile attacks are allowed, but only on cities that occupy space or gather in another alliance's territory.</li>
            <li><strong>Scheduled Battles:</strong> Alliances can schedule battles with each other by mutual agreement. Attacks outside these scheduled battles are considered dishonorable.</li>
            <li><strong>City Attacks:</strong> No attacks on cities unless the player is not part of an alliance.</li>
            <li><strong>Presidency Election:</strong> The presidency will be decided by an election where each alliance gets one vote.</li>
            <li><strong>Whale Distribution:</strong> High-powered players ("whales") should be distributed across the top 10 alliances to ensure power is not concentrated within just a few alliances. This will make facility battles more competitive, fun, and a learning experience for everyone.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Thank you for being part of ZAP!</p>
