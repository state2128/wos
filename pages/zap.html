            <p>Welcome to the APES page, where alliances (apes) collaborate to maintain harmony and competitiveness in State 2128. If your alliance chooses not to participate, you may opt out, but respect the rules if you remain in ZAP. By default, all alliances are opt'd in.</p>

            <h2 class="text-primary">APES Rules</h2>
            <ul class="list-group">
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <strong>Freedom of Speech:</strong> No restrictions on speech in world or private chats. If you find someone's language offensive, use the blacklist feature to block them.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <strong>City Attacks:</strong> Only players with a Furnace level of 20 or below are allowed to attack, and they may only target other players who are also at Furnace level 20 or below. This helps minimize troop losses and prepares everyone for larger future events. All players are encouraged to create a secondary account and keep it at Furnace level 20 or below to practice combat and enjoy battles.

Be reasonableâ€”do not completely destroy ("zero") cities. The first few weeks are meant for learning and adjustment. If you prefer not to be attacked, use a shield or take steps to protect your troops. This approach allows everyone to learn, adjust, and enjoy the game without causing unnecessary damage.
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <strong>Scouting:</strong> Scouting is permitted at all times.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <strong>Alliance Structures:</strong> Attacks on Alliance Headquarters or banners are strictly prohibited.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <strong>Tile Attacks:</strong> Tile attacks are allowed, but only on cities that occupy space or gather in another alliance's territory.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <strong>Scheduled Battles:</strong> Alliances can schedule battles with each other by mutual agreement. Have some honor, quit attacking when everyone is offline.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <strong>Presidency Rotation:</strong> The Presidency will rotate between alliances in APES. Each alliance can decide who they want as president when it is their turn.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <strong>Whale Distribution:</strong> High-powered players ("whales") should be distributed across the top 10 alliances to ensure power is not concentrated within just a few alliances. This will make facility battles more competitive, fun, and a learning experience for everyone.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <strong>Fortress/Stronghold Distribution:</strong> Fortresses and Strongholds will be rotated to all alliances in APES. An alliance must have at least 50 active members to get a fortress or stronghold, if your alliance does not then begin merging or play without them.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <strong>State vs State:</strong> Players will switch alliances to better assist in State vs State event but must return to their alliance after the event unless they wish to stay in the alliance they joined and there is space to do so.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <strong>Recruitment:</strong> Recruiting through world chat or through private messages is permitted at all times.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <strong>Facilities:</strong> All facilities are a free for all. No blocking alliances from building to facilities.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="mt-5">
            <h2 class="text-primary">Opt-Out Information</h2>
            <p>If your alliance chooses to opt out of APES, notify the leadership council. Opting out means your alliance will not be protected by APES rules, and other alliances may engage freely with your members. Ensure this decision aligns with your alliance's goals and strategy.</p>
