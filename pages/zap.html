            <h2 class="text-primary">ZAP Rules</h2>
            <ul class="list-group">
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <strong>Freedom of Speech:</strong> No restrictions on speech in world or private chats. If you find someone's language offensive, use the blacklist feature to block them.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <strong>City Attacks:</strong> Attacking cities is prohibited unless the player is not part of an alliance or the alliance has opt'd out of ZAP. Players with a Furnace level of 20 or below on day 70 of the state can be targeted. All players are encouraged to create a second account and maintain it at Furnace level 20, allowing the state to practice combat on these accounts while still keeping the state strong for State vs State event.
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <strong>Scouting:</strong> Scouting is permitted at all times.

                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <strong>Scheduled Battles:</strong> Alliances can schedule battles with each other by mutual agreement. Have some honor, quit attacking when everyone is offline.

                    <strong>Whale Distribution:</strong> High-powered players ("whales") should be distributed across the top 10 alliances to ensure power is not concentrated within just a few alliances. This will make facility battles more competitive, fun, and a learning experience for everyone.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <strong>Fortress/Stronghold Distribution:</strong> Fortresses and Strongholds will be rotated to all alliances in ZAP. An alliance must have at least 50 active members to get a fortress or stronghold, if your alliance does not then begin merging or play without them.

                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <strong>State vs State:</strong> Players will switch alliances to better assist in State vs State event but must return to their alliance after the event unless they wish to stay in the alliance they joined and there is space to do so.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <strong>Recruitment:</strong> Recruiting through world chat or through private messages is permitted at all times.

            <h2 class="text-primary">Opt-Out Information</h2>
            <p>If your alliance chooses to opt out of ZAP, notify the leadership council. Opting out means your alliance will not be protected by ZAP rules, and other alliances may engage freely with your members. Ensure this decision aligns with your alliance's goals and strategy.</p>
