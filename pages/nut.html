            <h2 class="text-primary">NUT Rules</h2>
            <ul class="list-group">
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <strong>Freedom of Speech:</strong> No restrictions on speech in world or private chats. If you find someone's language offensive, use the blacklist feature to block them.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <strong>City Attacks:</strong> Players with a Furnace level of 20 or below are allowed to attack any player at any time, regardless of Furnace level. This provides an opportunity for practice and enjoyment of combat while preparing for larger future events. All players are encouraged to create a secondary account and keep it at Furnace level 20 or below to participate in these battles. Do not attack 1 city over and over to "zero" them, be reasonable.
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <strong>Scouting:</strong> Scouting is permitted at all times.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <strong>Alliance Structures:</strong> Attacks on Alliance Headquarters or banners are strictly prohibited.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <strong>Tile Attacks:</strong> Tile attacks are allowed, but only on cities that occupy space or gather in another alliance's territory.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <strong>Scheduled Battles:</strong> Alliances can schedule battles with each other by mutual agreement. Have some honor, quit attacking when everyone is offline.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <strong>Presidency Rotation:</strong> The Presidency will rotate between alliances in APES. Each alliance can decide who they want as president when it is their turn.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <strong>Whale Distribution:</strong> High-powered players ("whales") should be distributed across the top 10 alliances to ensure power is not concentrated within just a few alliances. This will make facility battles more competitive, fun, and a learning experience for everyone.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <strong>Fortress/Stronghold Distribution:</strong> Fortresses and Strongholds will be rotated to all alliances in NUT. An alliance must have at least 50 active members to get a fortress or stronghold, if your alliance does not then you can still attack a fortress or stronghold but you will not be rotated one.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <strong>State vs State:</strong> Players will switch alliances to better assist in State vs State event but must return to their alliance after the event unless they wish to stay in the alliance they joined and there is space to do so.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <strong>Recruitment:</strong> Recruiting through world chat or through private messages is permitted at all times. If your alliance members aren't loyal, then your leader or fellow alliance members are probably the problem.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <strong>Facilities:</strong> All facilities are a free for all. No blocking alliances from building to facilities.
                </li>

        <section class="mt-5">
            <h2 class="text-primary">Opt-Out Information</h2>
            <p>If your alliance chooses to opt out of NUT, notify the leadership council. Opting out means your alliance will not be protected by NUT rules, and other alliances may engage freely with your members. Ensure this decision aligns with your alliance's goals and strategy.</p>
