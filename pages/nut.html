                Brothers in Arms is a high-intensity, two-day PvP event in Whiteout Survival where alliances battle for dominance by attacking enemy cities and troops. 
                Players earn points by killing or severely injuring troops, with rewards based on individual and alliance rankings. Strategic coordination is key, as 
                alliances must balance offense and defense while protecting their own resources and structures.

                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <strong>City Attacks:</strong> Max 2 attacks per city. If a city is burning, it means someone has already attacked twice. Move on.

                    <strong>Alliance Structures:</strong> HQs and banners are off-limits.

                    <strong>Tile Combat:</strong> Resource tiles are free game; gather at your own risk.

                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <strong>Team Strategy Allowed:</strong> Organized group attacks are fine within attack limits.

            <h2 class="text-primary">Opt-Out Information</h2>
            <p>If your alliance chooses to opt out of NUT, notify the leadership council. Opting out means your alliance will not be protected by NUT rules, and other alliances may engage freely with your members. Ensure this decision aligns with your alliance's goals and strategy.</p>
